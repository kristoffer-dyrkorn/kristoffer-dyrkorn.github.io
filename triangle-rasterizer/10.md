# 10. Epilogue

I hope the tutorial has brought you some new ideas and insights! It is the result of some time spent reading and exploring the concepts, and of testing them out in code. My main sources have been:

- [This article series](https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2013/02/06/the-barycentric-conspirac/) by Fabian Giesen (ryg)
- Scratchapixel's [article](https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/rasterization-practical-implementation) on rasterization

In the series here I've tried to shed some light on topics that are rarely explained in detail. Hopefully this will have made it easier to learn the entire process behind triangle rasterization.

Did you miss anything? Where some things hard to understand? Or simply not correct? Feel free to [give me feedback](https://github.com/kristoffer-dyrkorn/triangle-rasterizer/issues)!

## What next?

There are endless ways to continue on the work here. Some ideas:

- modifying the rasterizer so it works on tiles (squares of, for example, 8x8 pixels)
- making the rasterizer run on tiles, and in parallel (just like GPUs do)
- adding support for more advanced triangle filling:
  -- interpolated vertex colors (linear interpolation is fast, but not correct)
  -- perspective correct interpolation of vertex colors or textures
  -- shading (interpolation of vertex normals and light calculations for each pixel)
