# 10. Epilogue

(This article is the last part of a [series](./#sections). You can jump to the [previous section](9) if you would like to.)

I hope the tutorial has brought you insights and ideas! The material here is the result of spending time reading, exploring, testing out the concepts in code. The main sources have been:

- [This article series](https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2013/02/06/the-barycentric-conspirac/) by Fabian Giesen (ryg)
- Scratchapixel's [article](https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/rasterization-practical-implementation) on rasterization

In this series I've tried to share more details on topics that are rarely explained, such as the determinant adjustments, floating-point imprecision, the need to use fixed-point numbers, and the relation between fixed-point numbers and subpixels. Hopefully this have made it easier for you to see the whole process involved in high-quality triangle rasterization.

Did you miss anything? Were some of the topics hard to understand? Was something incorrect? Feel free to [give me feedback](https://github.com/kristoffer-dyrkorn/triangle-rasterizer/issues)!

## What next?

There are endless ways to further develop the work here. Some ideas:

- Modifying the rasterizer to work on tiles (ie squares of, for example, 8x8 pixels)
- Making the rasterizer run in parallel on each tile (just like GPUs do)
- Adding support for more advanced triangle filling:
  - Interpolated vertex colors (linear interpolation is fast, but not correct in a 3D setting)
  - Perspective correct interpolation - of vertex colors or textures
  - Shading: Interpolation of vertex normals, doing light calculations for each pixel

Have fun!

Kristoffer
