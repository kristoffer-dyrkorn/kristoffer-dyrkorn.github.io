# Faster horizontal lines

(This article is part of a [series](./#sections). You can jump to the [previous section](2) or the [next section](4) if you would like to.)

Our rasterizer is inherently serial. There are no functions that run in parallel. Given our runtime environment, JavaScript in the browser, we have no obvious way to make the code do more per time unit. (Web workers have too much overhead to be useful here.)

Still, we want to make our code more effective. We can use a little trick: Although we cannot make our code run in parallel, we can still make the data processing happen in parallel. Or, at least, we can make our code process more data per unit of time.

This is often referred to as SIMD: Single instruction, multiple data. The idea is that in a tight loop that does some data processing, it can be more effective to let each iteration work on a larger data chunk at a time.

In the code for drawing horizontal lines, we currently write pixel values to our screen buffer one byte at a time. That means we need to send 4 bytes to the screen buffer to update one pixel. However, writing 4 bytes to this buffer is just as fast as writing 1 byte. This means we can make the loop run quite a bit faster if we set up the code inside the loop so that we draw one pixel - 4 bytes - per iteration.

## The implementation

We do this by wrapping the raw image data buffer (an array buffer created by the Canvas API) in a typed array (here: a Uint32Array). This creates a 32-bit view into the raw image buffer for us - which enables us to write 4 bytes, a full pixel, at a time.

The code looks like this:

```JavaScript
  const arrayBuffer = imageData.data.buffer;
  screenBuffer = new Uint32Array(arrayBuffer);
```

When we want to write pixels on screen, we first make a 32-bit integer out of the 4 byte values. This only needs to be done once per triangle since we only draw single-color triangles now.

```JavaScript
    // bake the pixel color as a int32 RGBA value (little-endian)
    let finalColor = color[0];
    finalColor |= color[1] << 8;
    finalColor |= color[2] << 16;
    finalColor |= 255 << 24;
```

Then we let the innermost pixel-drawing loop, where performance really matters, do just one write to the pixel buffer per iteration:

```JavaScript
    while (x <= endx) {
      this.buffer[screenOffset + x] = finalColor;
      x++;
    }
```

And with that, we now draw our horizontal lines more effectively.

In the next section, we will take a deep dive into scan conversion again. We will (finally) start improving the visual quality of the animation - we will add support for subpixel precision so the triangles rotate smoothly.

If you want, you can have a look at the [demo app for this section](3/) - or, you can just jump directly to the [next section](4).
