# Use the math, Luke

(This article is part of a [series](./#sections). You can jump to the [previous section](4) or the [next section](6) if you would like to.)

In the previous section we calculated a new initial value for the numerator. The code we added looked like this:

```JavaScript
    // get the fractional x coordinate where the edge intersects the horizontal line through the pixel center
    const x_intersect = start_x_fractional - Math.round((start_y_fractional - FixedPointVector.HALF) * dx_dy);

    // calculate the horizontal offset from the ideal starting point (the pixel center)
    const x_offset = x_intersect - FixedPointVector.HALF;

    // convert the offset into a numerator value, by multiplying by dy and rounding off
    let numerator = (dy * x_offset + FixedPointVector.HALF) >> FixedPointVector.SHIFT;
```

It turns out these calculations can be simplified quite a bit. If we remove the rounding when calculating `x_intersect`, and keep in mind that `dx_dy` actually is `dx / dy`, we can merge and rewrite the expressions as:

```JavaScript
    let numerator = (dy * (start_x_fractional - FixedPointVector.HALF) -
                     dx * (start_y_fractional - FixedPointVector.HALF)) >> FixedPointVector.SHIFT;
```

This means that we only need two multiplications and three subtractions to add subpixel precision to the scan conversion process. Not bad! The improvement in visual quality certainly is worth the extra calculations.

Also note that the last expression here is more exact than the first version - as we now no longer do any divisions or rounding.

The core part of the scan conversion code becomes:

```JavaScript
    let numerator = (dy * (start_x_fractional - FixedPointVector.HALF) -
                     dx * (start_y_fractional - FixedPointVector.HALF)) >> FixedPointVector.SHIFT;


    // get the x coordinate of the first pixel
    let x = start[0];

    // truncate the fixed point start and end y coordinates since we operate on integer y coordinates
    let y = start[1] >> FixedPointVector.SHIFT;
    let end_y = end[1] >> FixedPointVector.SHIFT;

    while (y < end_y) {
      numerator += dx;
      if (numerator > dy) {
        x += pixel_step;
        numerator -= dy;
      }
      buffer[y] = x;
      y++;
    }
```

Have a look at the [final version of the demo app](5/). And with that, we are done - for now, at least. In the [next section](6) we will sum up this article and compare and contrast the two rasterizing methods we have been looking at.
